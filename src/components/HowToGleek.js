        <h2>HOW TO GLEEK</h2>
        <p>Gleeking is the act of shooting saliva out from under your tongue. 
          Many people have gleeked on accident when yawning or flicking their 
          tongue. You can teach yourself how to gleek on purpose by gathering 
          enough saliva, flicking your tongue along the roof of your mouth, and 
          jutting your jaw out. Although gleeking can be quite difficult, you 
          can likely teach yourself how to gleek with enough practice!</p>
          <h3>Method 1: Shooting that shit</h3>

        </div>
        <p>1: Yawn a couple of times to stimulate saliva. Yawning can be an easy 
          way to generate saliva. Even if you aren’t feeling sleepy, try yawning 
          a few times. You’d be surprised how strongly your body responds to the 
          simple act by producing a bunch of spit. - Always cover your mouth 
          when yawning in public. You can still be polite when you’re trying to gleek.

        </div>
        <p>2: Eat a sour candy to trigger your salivary gland. Most sour candies 
          will stimulate your salivary glands and generate enough saliva to gleek. 
          Get a pack of sour candies and throw some in your mouth. After sucking 
          on them for a few seconds, you should have plenty of saliva. - Too much 
          sugar is bad for your teeth. Make sure that you clean your mouth out 
          if you’re eating a lot of it.</p>

        </div>
        <p>3: Drink some water to moisturize your mouth. Water is an excellent way to stimulate 
          your salivary glands. It also has the added benefit of being good for you! If you’re 
          having trouble salivating, drink a little bit of water. You’d be surprised by how 
          moist your mouth will fee</p>
        <div className="meme-container">
          <img className='meme-border' src='./images/How To Gleek/4.png' alt=''/>
        </div>
        <p>4: Pucker your lips together and take a deep breath. Form a small circle by pursing 
          your lips together. It’s incredibly hard to breathe and gleek at the same time, so 
          you’ll want to catch your breath before attempting to gleek. Take a deep breathe 
          and relax your shoulders. - A deep breath will give the salivary gland time to generate 
          enough spit around the bottom of your tongue.</p>
        <div className="meme-container">
          <img className='meme-border' src='./images/How To Gleek/5.png' alt=''/>
        </div>
        <p>5: Flex your tongue and extend it against the roof of your mouth. To flex your tongue, 
          tighten the muscles by pushing it upwards and outwards towards the roof of your mouth. 
          Press your tongue in the area between your upper teeth and the skin on the roof of your 
          mouth. When you're ready to gleek, make this motion in one action and as quickly as 
          possible. Your tongue should stiffen as you flex it, and you’ll know that you’re doing 
          it right if it feels rigid and stiff in your mouth.</p>
        <div className="meme-container">
          <img className='meme-border' src='./images/How To Gleek/6.png' alt=''/>
        </div>
        <p>6: Open your mouth and push your bottom jaw out. Open your mouth as wide as you comfortably 
          can and extend your lower jaw away from you and towards your target. Flex the muscles in 
          your tongue as hard as you can while doing this. With enough practice, you will naturally 
          shoot out a stream of saliva from the gland beneath your tongue. - It may be tempting to try 
          and purse your lips together, since that’s what most people do when they normally spit. This 
          will block the gland at the bottom of your tongue though, so try to avoid doing it while you 
          gleek. Keep your tongue locked to the roof of your mouth while you’re doing this.</p>
        <h3>Method 2: Honing your skills</h3>
        <div className="meme-container">
          <img className='meme-border' src='./images/How To Gleek/7.png' alt=''/>
        </div>
        <p>1: Keep practicing until you get the hang of it. Gleeking is very difficult, and it’s likely 
          that you won’t be successful the first time that you try to do it. Remain persistent and try 
          it again. Make sure that you have enough saliva built up each time that you try to do it. -
          It may take a couple of practice sessions before you start to see results. If you’re doing it 
          correctly, the spit should be shooting out from underneath your tongue, not the back of your 
          throat. The shower is the perfect place to practice gleeking. You’re already cleaning yourself, 
          so it’s not the end of the world if you happen to spit a little. Practice the motion over and 
          over again. You can also wash your mouth out if it dries out!</p>
        <div className="meme-container">
          <img className='meme-border' src='./images/How To Gleek/8.png' alt=''/>
        </div>
        <p>2: Chew on the tip of your tongue to generate saliva if your mouth stays dry. If you chew on 
          the tip of your tongue after eating something, you may get a tingly sensation in the bottom of 
          your jaw. This is the saliva that you need to gleek properly. Lightly chewing on the tip of your 
          tongue is an excellent way to build up a lot of saliva fast and can be a simple solution if you 
          you’re your throat drying out a lot.</p>
        <div className="meme-container">
          <img className='meme-border' src='./images/How To Gleek/9.png' alt=''/>
        </div>
        <p>3: Try exhaling while you gleek if you aren’t getting any distance. If you’re not seeing results 
          in terms of the distance of your gleeks, you may be inhaling while you’re doing it. Try exhaling 
          right as you push your tongue forward and see if that helps.</p>
        <div className="meme-container">
          <img className='meme-border' src='./images/How To Gleek/10.png' alt=''/>
        </div>
        <p>4: Work on making the tongue flicking one motion. Although there are several steps involved, 
          the odds of successfully gleeking improve if you can perform each step quickly and in one fluid 
          motion. Practice working on it daily to get the steps down and improve your chances.</p>
        <div className="meme-container">
          <img className='meme-border' src='./images/How To Gleek/11.png' alt=''/>
        </div>
        <p>5: Try gleeking in front of a mirror to see how you’re doing it. It may be easier to improve 
          if you study what you look like in the mirror when you try to gleek. Compare your attempts at 
          gleeking to what it looks like when other people do it. Just be sure to clean off your mirror 
          if you happen to spit on it! - Never gleek on other people. Gleeking is a neat trick to show 
          your friends, but it isn’t something you want to do to another person.</p>
