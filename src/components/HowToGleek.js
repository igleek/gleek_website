			<h2>HOW TO GLEEK</h2>
			<p>
				Gleeking is that thing when you yawn and accidentally spit shoots out of
				your mouth. Scientifically it's a remnant from when we was cobras
				(Cobras -&gt; Apes -&gt; Neanderthals -&gt; Soyjaks). If you've never
				gleeked don't stress. This is the cobra pit. Where we train you to
				release your inner snake that has slept dormant for millennia. It's time
				to reclaim it. Follow along for our HOW-TO.

			<p>
				1. Enter the mindframe of a snake. Picture yourself as a capable
				predator, and NOTHING like the PATHETIC simp you woke up as this
				morning.

			<p>
				2. Open your snake jaws, Put the tip of your tongue on the roof of your
				mouth. Fatten your tongue wide, as if you were trying to cover as much
				of the airway's passage to your throat as possible with the fatness of
				your tongue.

			</div>
			<p>
				3. Yawning or biting the tip of your tongue will encourage saliva to
				flow, be careful not to bite too hard daddy...wait..

			</div>
			<p>
				4. Inhale a bunch of air. This will pressurize the gleek and make it
				shoot out faster.
			</p>
			<div className="how-to-container">

			</div>
			<p>
				5. Be mindful of your surroundings because here's when things get wet.
				Don't aim at any minors, elders or potential partners, as they will
				shame you for any unsuccessful attempts and we've seen enough to know
				your ego is fragile. Leave that behind.

			</div>
			<p>
				6. Rock your bottom jaw forwards and backwards to charge up the super
				soaker, keep that tongue fat, and envisage a helpless cowboy's leg in
				front of you, supple and ready for your venom
